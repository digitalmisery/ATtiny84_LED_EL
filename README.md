ATtiny84 LED + EL
=======================
This board was designed as a small and simple
way to sequence LEDs and electroluminescent (EL)
wire using PWM. The ATtiny84 was chosen not only
because of its small size but also so I could
test out the [ATTinyCore](http://github.com/TCWORLD/ATTinyCore) bootloader.
